1. 3 will be printed out because var makes i have function scope. In the for loop on line 6, prices.length is 3 from the function call on line 19. Therefore to exit the for loop i is 3. That is why at line 12 the output is 3.
2. 150 will be printed out because var makes dicountedPrice have function scope. On line 7, discountedPrice is set to 150 during the third and last iteration of the for loop. For that iteration, prices[i]=300 and discount is 0.5, 300 * (1 - 0.5) = 150. That is why 150 is the output of line 13.
3. 150 will be printed out because var makes finalPrice have function scope. As stated previously on the last iteration of the loop discountedPrice is 150. On line 8 Math.round(discountedPrice * 100)/100 is Math.round(150 * 100)/100=15000/100=150. Therefore 150 would be the output of line 14.
4. [50, 100, 150] would be what is returned. For every iteration of the for loop discounted is 0.5 from the function call. For the first iteration of the loop prices[i] is prices[0] which is 100, that makes discountedPrice 50 which also make finalPrice 50 before the value 50 is pushed into discounted. For the second iteration of the loop prices[i] is prices[1] which is 200, that makes discountedPrice 100 which also make finalPrice 100 before the value 100 is pushed into discounted. For the thrid and final full iteration of the loop prices[i] is prices[2] which is 300, that makes discountedPrice 150 which also make finalPrice 150 before the value 150 is pushed into discounted. That makes discounted = [50, 100, 150] which is the return value.
5. At line 12 Error: i not defined will be printed as the only time i is given a value is inside a previous block. However in that block let gives i block scope which means that instance of i only exisits within that block. Therefore at line 12 i has no value therefore that error will be produced.
6. At line 13 Error: discountedPrice not defined will be printed as the only time discountedPrice is given a value is inside a previous block. However in that block let gives discountedPrice block scope which means that instance of discountedPrice only exisits within that block. Therefore at line 13 discountedPrice has no value therefore that error will be produced.
7. At line 14, 150 will be printed because since finalPrice is initiated with let at the current level it will still have the value from when it was given a value inside of the previous block. On line 7, discountedPrice is set to 150 during the third and last iteration of the for loop. For that iteration, prices[i]=300 and discount is 0.5, 300 * (1 - 0.5) = 150. On line 8 Math.round(discountedPrice * 100)/100 is Math.round(150 * 100)/100=15000/100=150. Therefore 150 would be the output of line 14.

For the first iteration of the loop prices[i] is prices[0] which is 100, that makes discountedPrice 50 which also make finalPrice 50 before the value 50 is pushed into discounted.

That makes discounted = [50, 100, 150] which is the return value.
9. There would have been an error because you can not redefine the value of a const which is attempted on line 7.
